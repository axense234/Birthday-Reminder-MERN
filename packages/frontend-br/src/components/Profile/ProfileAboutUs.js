        <p>
          I am a guy who just likes web development and this is my first full
          MERN stack project, tho it has some flaws and mistakes that i will
          remember, it is a pretty good website(i think so).Now, the idea of
          Birthday Reminders was taken from a React Tutorial Project, where it
          was just simply a box with some reminders and a clear all button. This
          was too simple and i had a great idea to make it into an actual
          website. For some reason i am having fun building shit.
