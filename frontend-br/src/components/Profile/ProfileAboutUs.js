        <p>
          I am a guy who just likes web development,and this is my first full
          MERN stack object,tho it has some flaws and mistakes that il
          remember,it is a pretty good website(i think so).Now,the idea of
          Birthday Reminders was taken from a React Tutorial Project,where it
          was just simply a box with some reminders and a clear all button.This
          was too simple,and i had a great idea to make it into an actual
          website.I do not talking that much so il just finish this here.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
